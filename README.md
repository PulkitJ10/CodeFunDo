We plan to design a website which would have two main functionalities with a web based application(SaveUs):


First: Early warning of earthquake or flood possibilities in the user's area (made available through details entered
       in user registration) using commonly used services like WhatsApp, SMS or e-mail (as selected by the user).
       Appropriate precautionary methods and guidelines will be recommended to the user. For eg. In case of a flood warning, 
       precautionary measures relevant to the situation will be forwarded to the user.
       
Second: The app can also be used in a post-disaster scenario, with the primary idea being helping in the user's rescue by 
        the rescue teams. The user would be able to send her location to the rescue teams along with tagging people in danger 
        in the nearby areas under one single request. The user(s) would then be notified of the details of the rescue team's 
        ETA and the rendezvous point(safe) on the map. Upon successful rescue of the user, she will be able to mark herself
        'Safe' and share on social platforms.
        
        
Development tools to be used: React for Frontend and Django for Backend development, 3rd party APIs to get notifications and 
                              alerts along with integration with WhatsApp and other services, Google Maps APIs for location 
                              fetching and usage.


Future Development prospects: Usage of self-developed APIs instead of 3rd party APIs and development of an Android app to
                              increase coverage and ease of use.
